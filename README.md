# CoCommute :car:

## Purpose and Vision
CoCommute is an application designed to facilitate easy and free car sharing amongst friends or colleagues on their way to and from work. The purpose of the app is to reduce the number of petrol and deisel vehicles on the road during commuting hours, and to create and maintain warmer relationships between individuals.

In addition to being environmentally damaging, commuting by car can be tiresome and lonely. It is hoped that co-commuting will help commuters to present their best selves at work after sharing the ride with a friend! 

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express
- Request
- EJS
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4
- Leaflet.js
- Jawg maps API

# In a future iteration, I would like to...
- Use a single page application structure instead of rendering views via EJS. Ideally, the application would have a React frontend and Node backend. As my confidence with the MERN stack grows, I will look to implement this.
